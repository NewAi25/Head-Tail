# 🪙 Head-Tail

A Python-based simulation tool to perform random coin tosses and analyze the probability distribution of tails in a series of flips.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🟡 **Single Coin Toss Simulation** — Flip a fair coin and get a random outcome: **Head** or **Tail**  
- 📈 **Probability Calculator** — Compute the probability of getting a certain number of tails over multiple coin tosses using combinatorial analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine

### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewAi25/Head-Tail.git
cd Head-Tail
```

### ▶️ Usage

To run the **coin toss simulator**:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the **probability calculator**:

```bash
python "Probability of number of Tails in number of coin flips.py"
```

## 📊 Example Output

**Single Coin Toss:**
```
Result: Head
```

**Probability Analysis (e.g., 3 tails in 5 flips):**
```
Probability of getting 3 tails in 5 flips: 31.25%
```
